Simple:
All public classes and properties will have Capital letters for each word.
ex:
Class1
SomeClass
SomeVeryLongBadlyNamedClass

All public classes and properties should be properly named. Names should be short and sweet, with a maximum of 3-4 words, and , 20 character limit.

Method arguments and local varables should start with lowercase, with the rest of the words starting with uppercase
sings
someVar
someReallyLongVar

Private varables should start with a _, with the first word being lowercase.
ex:
_x
_someVarable

All class varables should be private, with properties used to expose any varables as needed.


Any explicid conversions MUST contain error checking before the conversion, even if the chances of that error actually happining is 0.
The only excepton to this is when converting an Enum to its numrical type, ie (int)MyEnum.Value1
