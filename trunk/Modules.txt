As this is a framework, But i would like to have it modular so someone can literally drop in a file and have new functionality
To do this, there are several standards i would like to keep.

First:  All modules should be in the Tortoise.{Server or Client}.Module namespace
Second: Modules that override existing ones can have different filenames, but they should 
	keep the class name the same.
For example, Lets say someone makes a more fancy Main Menu. The class name should still be 
	MainMenu, so if someone has both files in the project, it will throw a compile time error.
Third: All modules contain a class that inherits ModuleLoader. This class should contain a
	paramaterless constructor, and will be imitated at the start of the application automatically.
	In the Load() function, it is best to check if a value the module has already been assigned,
	and if so, throw an exception.
	For example, a MainMenu replacement class would check to make sure the value "MainMenu"
	isn't set in Window.AvailableScreens.

Here are a list of Classes and Public methods one should expect to see. I am not going to use an 
interface as that limits someone a bit and adds more complexity if they want to modify stuff themselves.

All of these are focused on a purely online game. A game whose focus isn't purely online game play may not
follow these.

Any code should make sure they are null or not set, otherwise the code should throw a ModuleLoadException()

Client:
MainMenu
 - Deligate void LoginRequest(string, string)
  - This will be called when the MainMenu(which may contain a login box) requests a login check.
	  Any "Login" Module which does login stuff and version check and whatever else should use this.
