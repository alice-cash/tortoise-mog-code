Simple:
All public classes and properties will be Upper CamelCase

All public classes and properties should be properly named. Names should be short and sweet, with a maximum of 3-4 words, or 20 characters.

Method arguments and local variables should be lower CamelCase

Private variables should start with a _, and be lower CamelCase

All class variables should be private, with properties used to expose any variables as needed.


Any explicit conversions/boxing MUST contain error checking before the conversion, even if the chances of that error actually happening is 0.
These should preferably be in an extension method, or as a separate function in the class.
Use of the is and as keywords is preferred over boxing and explicit conversions.
